                  Transatlantic University was founded on a deeply held conviction: that Nigerian students
                  deserve a medical education that matches the best in the world. Established in {siteConfig.location.town},{" "}
                  {siteConfig.location.state}, the University bears the full name{" "}

                </p>
                <p>
                  Its founder, <strong>Dr. Godwin Maduka</strong>, is a Nigerian-American physician and
                  philanthropist whose career spans continents. His vision for TAU is simple and bold —{" "}
                  <strong>train the next generation of African health leaders who can practise, teach, and lead anywhere on earth.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, TAU is home to more than 8,000 students across six faculties, supported by 400+
                  academic staff, state-of-the-art simulation facilities, and a growing teaching hospital.
