                  The TAU Sustainability Charter commits the University to measurable reductions in energy use,
                  water consumption, and waste — while embedding environmental thinking in teaching, research,
                  and campus operations.

                  As a health sciences institution, we recognise the deep connection between the health of the
                  planet and the health of its people. Sustainability is not an add-on; it is part of how we
                  train the next generation of healthcare leaders.
